Project Structure
The project structure consists of three main files:

index.html: The HTML file defines the structure of the website, including the movie list, movie details, and ticket purchase functionality.
style.css: The CSS file contains styles for the website, providing a clean and responsive design.
index.js: The JavaScript file handles the dynamic content, fetches movie data from the server, and updates the UI accordingly.
